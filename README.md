# RBR CZ Tournament Creator Revamped
This repository contains source of Vue.js app that is aiming to make **Tournament creation** on [RBR CZ](https://rbr.onlineracing.cz/index.php?setlng=eng) much easier.

This is merely a prototype, most of the car/track data has been scrapped and this doesn't actually create tournaments.

[**Try it out**](https://suxinjke.github.io/rbrcz_prototype/)

### Improvements
* Single page application instead of making requests to view/edit tournament data.
* Better car and track lists
	* Ordered by name
	* Car groups to pick from instead of just adding all cars in a group
	* Track search
	* Adding random tracks
	* Changing order of tracks
* Easier management of legs
* Save/load of tournament presets
